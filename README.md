## Presentation

grafcet2plc is a Python software to generate source code for programmable logic controllers (PLC) based on GRAFCETs.

GRAFCET is a graphical specification language for the functional description of the
behaviour of the sequential part of the control systems.

Usually, once you entered a GRAFCET with a dedicated edition software for analysis for example, the very same GRAFCET must entered with the PLC constructor's software to implement the automaton if it is not supported by the edition software. The purpose of this software is giving an interface between edition softwares and PLC requirements to accelerate PLC programming.

It is currently developped for an old version of CADEPA and a Siemens Simatic S7-200.

## How to generate PLC code with an export from an edition software
*Under development*

## My PLC is not available. What should I do?
Code the class dumbass!

### How to add a PLC
*Coming soon*

## My input format is not available. What should I do?
Again, code the class.

### How to add an input format
*Coming soon*
